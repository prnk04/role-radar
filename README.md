# RoleRadar

## An AI-powered job search solution

## Problem Statement:

The job alerts that we receive from LinkedIn/Naukri/Company career websites are keyword-specific. We create job alerts based on the poosition we want to apply for and the location. However, many times those job postings do not meet our search criteria, or at times the job alert might not alert us about a role that woiuld be a prfect fit for us, just because it failed the keyword match.

## Solution:

Based on users' resume, description of the role they want, the title they want to target, and their preferred location, create a solution that would provide them personalised job recommendations
